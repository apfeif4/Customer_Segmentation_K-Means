# 👥 Customer Segmentation – K-Means Clustering

## 📝 Overview

This project uses **K-Means clustering** to group customers based on demographic information.
The insights from segmentation will help businesses create **targeted advertisements**, reducing marketing costs and improving conversion rates.

**Status:** ✅ Completed

---

## 🎯 Objective

A company wants to **reduce advertising expenses** by focusing only on customers most likely to purchase their products.
To achieve this, we will:

* Group customers into meaningful segments.
* Provide data-driven insights for **personalized marketing** strategies.

---

## 🛠️ Methods & Tools

**Methods**

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* K-Means Clustering (implemented from scratch)
* K-Means using Scikit-learn

**Technologies**

* Python (Jupyter Notebook)
* Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

---

## 📂 Data Sources

* Public dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) (included in this repository).

---

## 🚀 Project Workflow

1. **Data Acquisition** – Import customer demographic dataset from Kaggle.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation** – Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, normalize data.
3. **EDA** – Explore trends, patterns, and feature distributions.
4. **Clustering** – Implement K-Means both from scratch and with Scikit-learn.
5. **Cluster Analysis** – Interpret results and identify meaningful customer segments.
6. **Reporting** – Present insights and advertising recommendations.

---

## 📈 Deliverables

* **Jupyter Notebook** with code, analysis, and visualizations.
* **Cluster visualizations** showing customer groupings.
* **Marketing strategy recommendations** based on segmentation.

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Incorporate **transaction history** for behavioral segmentation.
* Use **hierarchical clustering** for comparison.
* Integrate **real-time segmentation** for live ad targeting.
